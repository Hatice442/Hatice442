Step 1: Update your system

Before installing any new software, itâ€™s a good idea to make sure your system is up-to-date. Open a terminal and run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

Step 2: Install dependencies (if needed)

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies for the installation process:

sudo apt install wget gpg

Step 3: Add the Microsoft repository for VS Code

To install the latest version of Visual Studio Code, you need to add the Microsoft repository to your system. Run the following commands:

    Download and install the Microsoft GPG key:

wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -

    Add the VS Code repository to your system's software sources:

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"

Step 4: Install Visual Studio Code

After adding the repository, update your package list and install VS Code:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install code

Step 5: Launch VS Code

Once the installation is complete, you can open Visual Studio Code by either:

    Typing code in the terminal, or
    Searching for "Visual Studio Code" in your application menu.
